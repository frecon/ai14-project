Just how far are we prepared to go when acting under the orders of someone else 
It is a question that has been at the centre of a number of news stories 
I have to admit that my usual reaction to such stories is to think that such things only happen to people with feet of clay and brains to match
It is certainly a lot more comforting than the alternative
Sitting in the office of a psychologist friend 
The book recounts how while at Yale University between 1960 and 1963 
After being told that the study would look at the effect of punishment on learning 
The experiment then began
The scientist in charge would instruct the recruit to deliver a shock at the next level of voltage 
Although separated by a wall the recruits could hear the pupil next door 
And as the mistakes accumulated so the protests from the room grew louder 
And despite all the screams from the room next door
What the recruits did not know was that the pupil was a stooge 
His experiment exploded many comforting myths women 
Would more people act like she did now 
However it is an experiment unlikely to be repeated any time soon 
For one can just imagine the lawsuits that would come from all those nice
Not that the engine always runs smoothly 
Far from it 
There is often plenty of room for disagreement over what is a scientific fact 
And there are ample opportunities for bullies and ignoramuses to win arguments through rhetoric rather than reason 
The entire history of science is full of tales of rows 
Aristotle arguably the first scientist
Nor is he shown any mercy
The great Irish wag used his jesting to tease and annoy just about everyone 
He has done a good job of collecting tales of error and misjudgment
The concept of the scientific blunder is a great theme for a popular book 
He has responded with some splendid howlers
But by failing to illuminate how scientists continually exploit their errors in their quest for truth 
He was the founder and chief executive of the company
Southwest enjoyed both profits and labor peace even in the worst years for the industry 
He lost and was carried off on a stretcher with an intravenous line connected to a bottle of Wild Turkey 
It was one of the few good laughs heard in the industry in years 
The majority of scientists bask in the surviving afterglow of the Enlightenment 
Is the terminus that time forgot
For years the Victorian fairy tale castle has stood half deserted in its Gothic sleep 
Small scale enterprises common in the private 
If any nutrient could use an image makeover 
Women of child bearing age are routinely excluded from drug trials 
Measles mumps and whooping cough can also be prevented with vaccines
The evolution of drug resistant strains is the most famous example of such an effect
But now a new worry has emerged 
It appears that intervening in infections may have undesirable effects on the hosts that is
The first possible effect is the replacement of one disease by another
As the incidence of childhood infections has fallen
In parts of the world where childhood diseases are still common
A direct link between these two phenomena is not yet proven
This may be because there isnâ€™t one
Doctors in rich countries have the experience to detect
All this talk of space travel is utter bilge
