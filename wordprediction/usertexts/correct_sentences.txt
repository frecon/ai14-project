Do you have a tuxedo
It broke
Do not overdo it
Have you changed outfit
The door was closed with a bang
Can you shut the window
Do you want to iron your clothes
I like to eat berries
I think I will skip the tea this morning
We had a problem flushing the toilet
It is probably rape fields
I always have a fun time at parties
Toilet is out of order
When were you born
Sorry to hear about your diarrhea
I need to go the the toilet and have a pee
Can you pass me the mashed potatoes
This morning was very cold
She is a friend of mine
Could I have some water because my friend is fainting
I need to borrow a pen from you
where are you
He teaches children
He checks passports at the airport
We are going on holiday together
I am hung over
I like smorgasbords
She is very strong
I want to play pinball
Have you read any good paperbacks lately
Can I have a glass of wine
Do you want to play basketball
I have my hair in a slickback
Can I have the recipe for this soup
I work as a photographer
I am investigating this case
What is the interest on your bank loan
The data was treated in the following way
My phone is vibrating
I like to eat ice cream
Put the cups on the tray
It is cold in Iceland
These are my children
I am going to the office on the fifth floor
Can you write a sentence?
May I have the pleasure of this dance?
Would you like to go to the cinema
Use the water hose to water the flowers
It is going to be good weather tomorrow
